This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Website and Portfolio 3.0!!! 


### How to view website:

1. Git clone this repo into a folder of your choosing or create a new one to specifically view this site
2. `cd` into the folder 'Updated_Website_2019'
3. `cd` into the folder 'website_portfolio_2019' 
4. run the command `npm` start to start her up! 
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view working website in the browser


**Note: This website is a work in progress. Ultimately, I will be hosting it on Heroku. Once this is complete, I will also provide a link to view the site live! 

Thanks,
Devon
